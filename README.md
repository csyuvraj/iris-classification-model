Iris Flower Classifier 
This project is a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It's built to demonstrate a basic but complete ML pipeline. 

Goal
To train a model to accurately predict an Iris species based on its physical measurements (sepal and petal length/width).

The Process
1-Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded and split for training and testing.
2-Data Scaling: The features are standardized to improve model performance.
3-Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the prepared data.
4-Evaluation: The model's accuracy is tested on a separate dataset to ensure it works on new, unseen data.
5-Persistence: The trained model and data scaler are saved for future use.

Results

1-The model achieved an outstanding 100% accuracy on the test set, successfully classifying all 30 flowers correctly.
2-This project showcases a fundamental understanding of how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model.
